Outside of my scientific research, I have worked on projects in games and interactive media, including commercial products, technology demonstrations, and art installations. Some of the major ones are summarized below.

## BlueMarble Surface Shader Tutorial (2012)
A test project and [accompanying tutorial]({% post_url 2012-04-24-unity3d-surface-shader-tutorial %}) to learn about using surface shaders in Unity3D, using NASA's BlueMarble Next Generation dataset.

## Power Glove 20th Anniversary Edition (2009)
A stripped-out and retrofitted Nintendo Power Glove, using an Arduino microcontroller, 3-axis accelerometer, original finger bend sensors, and communicating with the computer via Bluetooth. Wireless!

## TouchKO (2009, iOS)
Realistic-visuals boxing game built for then-current iPhone 3G. Collaboration with Adam Mechtley, UI art by [Michael Heald](http://www.fullyillustrated.com/), published by Chillingo (now EA). I'm especially proud of my optimization work to have this on iPhone 3G: Roughly 48MB max of available working application memory, and garbage collector only hits on scene transitions to ensure smooth gameplay.

## Blurst.com (2007-2009)
Work at indie video game developer Flashbang Studios. In two years with a core team of six, we produced seven arcade-style score-attack games and three iPhone games, primarily in Unity3D. We focused on rapid iteration and prototyping, and averaged a game every 8 weeks. I split coding work with 2 other core programmers and though I was designated quaternion slerper, I touched most systems on one or more projects, including AI, animation, physics, GUI, input/controls, gameplay, and random china shop generation.

Note: With the original Unity Web Player replaced by the newer WebGL player, the original projects all need to be updated to newer Unity versions for WebGL builds, so they aren't currently online. Gameplay videos below!

### Time Donkey (2009)
A mild-mannered donkey, unstuck in the same 30 seconds of time, forced to live it over and over. Interact with your past selves to explore, escape, and collect tacos. waH eeH!

### Minotaur in a China Shop (2008)

## Appreciating Hubble at Hyper-speed (2007)
An interactive tool for exploring the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field and demonstrating cosmology and galaxy evolution concepts such as the relationship between redshift and distance, expansion of the universe, and hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Produced with the support an [Arizona/NASA Space Grant Consortium](http://nasa.asu.edu/) undergraduate fellowship.
