Putting into perspective the [House's recent recommendation](http://www.space.com/12187-nasa-budget-bill-cancels-space-telescope-house.html) to defund the James Webb Space Telescope.

The <del>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</del> **Afghan War (AW)** Independent Comprehensive Review Panel revealed chronic and deeply rooted management problems in the <del>JWST</del> **AW** project. These issues led to the project cost being underestimated by as much as <del>$1,400,000,000</del> **trillions of dollars** relative to the most recent baseline, and the budget could continue to rise depending on the final <del>launch</del> **withdrawal** date determination. Although <del>JWST</del> **the AW** is a particularly serious example, significant cost overruns are commonplace at <del>NASA</del> **DoD**, and the Committee believes that the underlying causes will never be fully addressed if the Congress does not establish clear consequences for failing to meet budget and schedule expectations. The Committee recommendation provides no funding for <del>JWST</del> **AW** in fiscal year 2012.

The Committee believes that this step will ultimately benefit <del>NASA</del> **DoD** by setting a cost discipline example for other projects and by relieving the enormous pressure that <del>JWST</del> **AW** was placing on <del>NASA's</del> **DoD’s** ability to pursue other <del>science</del> **national security** missions.
