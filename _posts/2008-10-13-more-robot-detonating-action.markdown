Adam and I have been hard at work continuing development of our robot game the last couple weeks, which we are now calling !Rebolt! A lot of this has been simply fleshing out gameplay flow (doing the weapon equip menu, etc), and optimizations to make it run well on the iPhone. However, we've also made two new weapons, the Torch, a little flamethrower, and the awe-inspiring Singularity Cannon, a weapon which rips small black holes in the fabric of space, crushing your enemies inside. I made a new video last night to show off this piece of work:

Yes, that's part of the [Hubble Ultra-Deep Field](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2004/07/) image inside the black hole. ;)
