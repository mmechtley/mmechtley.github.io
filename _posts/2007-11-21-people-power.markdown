I've been looking to buy a bike for some time, essentially since Adam bought one a little over a year ago. I like the idea of human-powered transportation - it's wholly sustainable and it's good exercise, too. I found this bike on Craigslist over the weekend - it was only used for about a year by the previous owner, and has just been sitting in his garage since. It's in practically brand-new condition, and at $220 I got it for about half the cost of a new one. I dig it because it's a hybrid, so it's lightweight like a street bike, but has beefy enough tires and rims that I can ride it on unpaved areas like the many canal paths in Phoenix.
