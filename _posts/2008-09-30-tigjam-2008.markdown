This last weekend saw a gathering of indie video game developers for the inaugural TIGJam, hosted by [TIGSource](http://tigsource.com) and us at [Flashbang Studios](http://blurst.com). 20 indie developers from all over the US and Canada came together for 72 hours of game-making with our comrades in arms!

Armed with a bottle of guarana pills, the company of awesome friends, and the promise of a fabulous Indian dinner as culmination, I set out with my brother Adam to start a project from scratch and finish as much as possible. We decided on a game for the iPhone, made using the beta for [Unity](http://unity3d.com)'s iPhone version of their software. Our game is a 3D customizable robot brawler, in the spirit of the fantastic Sega Genesis game [Cyborg Justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_Justice).

After three days of TIGJam, we ended up with a nicely fleshed-out prototype, including enemy robots, three selectable weapons (grabber arm, minigun, and rocket launcher), and, of course, exploding barrels. We made this video earlier today, showcasing a total of four days of work:

There were some other fantastic games being worked on during the jam, including a number for the upcoming [Gamma 3D](http://www.kokoromi.org/gamma3d) showcase. My personal favorite (other than of course [World of Goo](http://2dboy.com/games.php), which Kyle and Ron of 2D Boy were working on) was Alec Holowka and Adam Saltsman's [curling game](http://infiniteammo.ca/blog/curling/), which looks completely sick after only three days of work!

Photos from the jam are up in my [Flickr stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mmechtley/sets/72157607591863260/). Adam and I plan to be finished with our robot project by the time that Unity iPhone reaches release -- I'll update as it comes along!
