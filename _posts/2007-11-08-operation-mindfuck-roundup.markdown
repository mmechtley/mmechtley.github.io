[Operation Mindfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mindfuck) is a wide-reaching decentralized conspiracy that extends to the highest levels of power in the world. Its purpose is to disrupt the reality grids that the general populace functions on, reminding people that there exist experiences and stimuli outside the confines of their everyday lives. As evidence of its popularity among even the powerful, I cite U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, particularly his [Incredible Hulk tie](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9492210).

For Halloween I joined friends making some [LED Throwies](http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=6#video) ([photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bekathwia/sets/72157602806019788/) - thanks Becky). We used them to make temporary improvements to a building and a sculpture:

I also spent a couple hours last weekend walking the new Tempe Marketplace shopping center with an accomplice, using one of [Limor's](http://ladyada.net) TV-B-Gone kits to disrupt the incredibly annoying TVs that seem to be in every store for no good reason. While the most satisfying was the one in the Cold Stone (also: delicious sorbet), the most impressive was the electronics section in the Target:

I've ordered one as well - the plan is to have two that cycle out of phase so as to turn off TVs twice as fast!

Overall, some of the best fun I've had in months!
