After playing with one of these little fellows [last weekend]({% post_url 2007-11-08-operation-mindfuck-roundup %}) I resolved that I had to have one of my own - I can't stand TVs in restaurants in particular, or ones that do nothing but play ads in stores.  So I ordered up my own [kit](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=20&amp;products_id=73) and assembled it per Limor's [instructions](http://www.ladyada.net/make/tvbgone/).

It had been about a year and a half since I'd had a chance to solder anything, which I realize now was far too long! Luckily, soldering seems to stick like bike riding - my joints were as clean and pretty as ever! Now just to test it out!
