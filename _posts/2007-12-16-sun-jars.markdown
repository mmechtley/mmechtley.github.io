I saw [an Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Home-made-Sun-Jar/) for these neat LED-lighted jars some time ago - I thought it would be cool to make a couple to leave in my room. It's a very simple hack - you gut a solar garden lamp, replace the LED if desired, and then place the parts into the lid of a large-mouth jar. Then simply do something to diffuse the light emitted - I used a glass frosting paint but you could just as easily add in a sheet of tracing paper or the like. I ended up making four - they turned out very nice, and I gave two away at the Phoenix DIY Meeting. Full Flickr [photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mmechtley/sets/72157603453391346/).
