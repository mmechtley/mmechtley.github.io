Here are a couple updates regarding previous projects. I've been spending free time lately reading, but I should have some new stuff soonish.

[[citation needed] stickers]({% post_url 2008-01-01-citation-needed %}) have been slowly showing up in new places. I've still got a number left, so if you want a few, just send me an email or a message via Flickr. A few from around Tempe and San Francisco are in the [Flickr tag pool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/citationneeded/):

[Reason Magazine](http://reason.com) also recently published [a short article](http://reason.com/news/show/124400.html) about the project, in their March issue. Don't be afraid -- they're much nicer Libertarians than some of the Randroids I've met!

I also finally had a chance to really test my [bicycle camera mount]({% post_url 2008-01-27-a-quick-release-bicycle-camera-mount %}) -- the lead-up to the Game Developers Conference had left me with little time for biking anywhere other than work. I went riding with Matthew and took [a few shots](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mmechtley/sets/72157604029750394/).

On a side note I don't recommend trail riding with this particular mount -- the constant jostling broke the conduit hanger I was using to mount the tripod head. Luckily it's the cheapest piece at only 50 cents, but the weight of the assembly demands something a bit sturdier than cheap plastic if you're going to be navigating bumpy terrain!
