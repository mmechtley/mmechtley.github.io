One of my favorite authors is the late [Robert Anton Wilson](http://www.rawilson.com). His own particular brand of absurdism resonates well with my own and has given me inspiration for all manner of crazy things! My favorite works tend to be his fiction -- especially the _Illuminatus!_ trilogy and its successor the _Schrödinger's Cat_ trilogy. _Illuminatus!_ in particular tells the story of the most fantastically absurd far-reaching conspiracy ever dreamed up in fiction or even _reality_. In short, it's pretty much got to have some truth to it.

In _Illuminatus!_, it's noted that you can tell where the Illuminati are exerting their influence by watching for subtle and recondite symbols they use -- the numbers 17 and 23, the images of the [Ouroboros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) and the Eye in the Pyramid, and the phrase  "Property of the Bavarian Illuminati! Ewige Blumenkraft!" Now, 17 and 23 I see everywhere. The Eye in the Pyramid is on the one dollar note. But I've noticed a disproportionately small number of property claims by the Illuminati, given their clearly far-reaching influence. In the spirit of accurate labeling, such as "antibacterial," "All-natural," and "[Now SLOWER and with MORE BUGS!](http://evilmadscience.com/else/62-bugs-stickers)," I've made these "Property of the Bavarian Illuminati! Ewige Blumenkraft!" stickers. They should be placed wherever the Illuminati's influence is painfully obvious, yet conspicuously undeclared!

There's a developing [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mmechtley/sets/72157606607615055/) where those came from! If anyone wants to modify them or make their own, I've posted the [source psd]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/assets/2008/illuminati_property.psd). I'll also have gobs at [Maker Faire Austin](http://makerfaire.com) this weekend (look for a gentleman in a top hat).

Ewige Blumenkraft!
O Hail Eris!
