It's no secret that I'm a big Wikipedia fan -- I've got a serious case of [NADD](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html) and about half my browser tabs at any given time are Wikipedia articles. One of my favorite quirks about the site are the little [[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] tags that users can place in an article, indicating that a dubious claim needs a reference. One day an idea struck -- what statements are more dubious or outright ridiculous than those in advertisements? Thus, an [OM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mindfuck) project was born. I had 250 8x2 inch stickers printed, which I handed out to friends, who circulated them further. In true wiki fashion, the final placement of the stickers is a collaborative effort, now distributed and anonymous. If anyone sees one somewhere, please make a photo! I've been tagging [my photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mmechtley/sets/72157603429112869/) on Flickr with [citationneeded](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/citationneeded/) and [wikiffiti](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/wikiffiti/) -- more should start showing up in the next few weeks. I'm also providing the [source Photoshop file]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/assets/2008/citation_needed.psd) (or [as pdf]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/assets/2008/citation_needed.pdf)) for anyone who wants to print their own batch.

Update: A few people have asked via Flickr about printing services. I found [uprinting.com](http://www.uprinting.com) via google, and ended up using them simply because their minimum order size was 250 instead of 500 -- there may be better or cheaper options available. They simply have a quote form you fill out, then you upload your file (such as the CMYK one above). Very painless overall.
