[The Independent Gaming Source](http://www.tigsource.com/) just finished up a [competition](http://www.tigsource.com/features/vgng/) based on the [Video Game Name Generator](http://www.norefuge.net/vgng/vgng.html). The rules:

- First, open up the Video Game Name Generator.
- Next, find a name for the game that you want to make. (Peeing your pants out of mirth is recommended during this part.)
- Finally, MAKE THAT GAME.
- Optional Secondary Objective: BRAND LEADERSHIP

My brother/coworker Adam and I decided we'd try our hand at one. We picked [Obsessive Compulsive Penguin Simulator]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/ocpenguinsim/), for obvious reasons. You play as a penguin with OCD, who must stamp down accumulating snow drifts, in order to keep the ground even for all! To promote [Brand Leadership](http://www.introversion.co.uk/), I also made this stunning promotional artwork:

The competition lasted three weeks, but we spent a total of about five days working on it -- three of Flashbang's experimental Fridays and then this last weekend. Now go [play the game]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/ocpenguinsim/) -- it plays in-browser for OS X and Windows!
