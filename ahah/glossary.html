	<h1>Glossary of Terms</h1>
	<p>The following is a glossary of terms that may be useful when using the 
		Appreciating Hubble at Hyper-speed application and associated 
		exercises.</p>
	<dfn><span class="term">Blackbody radiation</span> - the light emitted by a blackbody, which is a perfect absorber and emitter of electromagnetic radiation. The light from stars is well approximated by blackbody radiation, dependent on the temperature of the star.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Cepheid variables</span> - a type of star that exhibits a tight correlation between the period of the variation in its brightness and its absolute luminosity.  Often used as distance estimators to galaxies.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Cosmology</span> - the study of the past, present, 
		and future of the Universe</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Critical density</span> - the amount of mass per unit volume required to close the universe.  If the universe has more than the critical density, the universe will collapse upon itself; if the universe has a density less than or equal to the critical density, the universe will expand forever.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Cull size</span> - the smallest size (in pixels) for which a galaxy's image will be displayed. The default cull size is 4.  (See "Help" page)</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Doppler shift</span> - the change in frequency (or 
		wavelength) from a source due to the relative motion of the source and 
		observer</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Galaxy</span> - a gravitationally bound grouping of 
		stars, gas, and dust that is physically isolated in space</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">General relativity</span> - a theory which argues 
		that everything, including light, is affected by gravity. Introduced by 
		Albert Einstein in 1915.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Hubble constant</span> - the proportionality constant that arises from the Hubble Law, the relationship between a galaxy's expansion velocity and the distance to that galaxy.  An accurate value of the Hubble constant is required to know the critical density of the universe, as well as the age of the universe.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Hubble's Law</span> - a relationship between the 
		distance of a galaxy and its observed redshift, first noted by Edwin P. 
		Hubble in the early 1920's.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Light-year</span> - the distance that light travels 
		in one year. Equivalent to 9.48 x 10<sup>15</sup> m.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Morphology</span> - the study of structure</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Parallax</span> - the apparent change in the 
		position of an object due to a change in the observer's position</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Parsec</span> - the distance from the Sun at which 
		an object exhibits one arcsecond of parallax as seen from the Earth. 
		Equivalent to 3.26 light-years.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Redshift</span> - The light emitted or reflected from an object is shifted to longer wavelengths (to the "red" end of the spectrum) as seen by an observer with a relative motion away from the object.  If two objects have a relative motion towards each other, the light shows a "blueshift". </dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Special relativity</span> - a theory that explored 
		how measurements of time and space are affected by motions at high 
		constant speeds. Developed by Albert Einstein in 1905.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Stamp size</span> - within the AHaH application, the 
		size of the image containing a given galaxy. That is, the width (at the 
		galaxy's redshift) of the black box surrounding the galaxy within the 
		Info Box. The stamp size can be used to estimate a galaxy's proper 
		transverse diameter.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Type 1a supernovae</span> - an incredibly bright 
		explosion resulting from the collapse of a white dwarf star.  Can be used to estimate distances to galaxies.</dfn>
	<dfn><span class="term">Wave</span> - a traveling disturbance demonstrating 
		periodicity.</dfn>
