	<a name="installing">
	<h1>Installing and Running the Application</h1></a>
	<p>The Appreciating Hubble at Hyper-speed application is distributed as an 
		archive containing a standard executable Java resource file. To install 
		the application, simply <a href="./download.html">download</a> the 
		archive file for your operating system and save it wherever you prefer. 
		Extract the archive wherever you like and then double-click the ahah.jar 
		file to run the program. If you prefer to run from the command line, use 
		<code>java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;ahah.jar</code>.</p>
	<p>Also provided is a configuration file, <code>ahah.conf</code>, that 
		provides several options that you may modify if you want to use custom 
		settings every time you run the program. See the 
		<a href="#config">Configuration File</a> section for more 
		information.</p>
		
	<span class="jump"><a href="#index">Back to Index</a></span>
	
	<a name="mainscreen">
	<h1>Main Screen and User Interface</h1></a>
	<p>The main screen represents your primary interface with the application. 
		Besides holding the actual visualization, the screen also provides 
		various forms of information about the simulation and methods to 
		interact with and gain more information about specific galaxies.</p>
	<div class="images">

		</a></span>
	</div>
	<p>The numbered user interface elements are as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Position Indicator</strong>, showing the camera's x and y 
			position within the coordinate system, as well as the camera's 
			redshift.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="#hotkeys-geometry">Active Geometry 
			Indicator</a></strong>, showing whether the Universe's real geometry is 
			active or a non-physical geometry in which angular sizes are 
			unaffected by the Universe's expansion.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="#hotkeys-infobox">Info Box</a></strong> that shows 
			more information about the selected galaxy, including its HUDF ID, 
			redshift, and comoving radial distance.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="#hotkeys-jumpdialog">Jump Dialog</a></strong>, 
			where you may enter an Object ID or redshift on which to center the 
			camera.</li>
		<li><strong>Speed Indicator</strong>. Used to remind you that the speeds 
			represented in the application (when moving) are not physically 
			attainable.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<span class="jump"><a href="#index">Back to Index</a></span>
	
	<a name="moving">
	<h1>Moving the Camera</h1></a>
	<p>You may move the camera using either the mouse or keyboard, or with a 
		combination of both. We recommend that most users navigate with the 
		mouse, though advanced users may find the precision movement afforded by 
		the keyboard useful in some situations.</p>
	<p>To navigate using the mouse, simply click and hold the left mouse button 
		anywhere within the <a href="#mainscreen">Main Screen</a>. Moving the 
		mouse will then move the camera left, right, up, and down. To move 
		forward and backward, either scroll the mouse wheel up and down, or 
		click and hold the mouse wheel or middle mouse button, then move the 
		mouse forward and backward. You may also move forward and backward by 
		holding shift while clicking and holding the left mouse button.</p>
	<p>To navigate using the keyboard, simply use the arrow keys to move left, 
		right, up, and down. To move forward and backward, hold shift and use 
		the up and down arrow keys. Holding control while using keyboard 
		navigation will move the camera at 10x the normal speed.</p>
	<p>In addition to direct navigation, you may double left-click on any galaxy 
		to initiate an automatic move to it. This will move the camera at a 
		moderate pace along the line (geodesic) between the camera and the 
		galaxy. The automatic move can be cancelled at any time by performing 
		most other actions, such as attempting to move the camera or selecting a 
		galaxy. Note that toggling the <a href="#hotkeys-geometry">spatial 
		geometry mode</a> will <em>not</em> cancel an automatic movement.</p>
		
	<span class="jump"><a href="#index">Back to Index</a></span>
		
	<a name="hotkeys">
	<h1>Hotkeys and Special Functions</h1></a>
	<p>The application contains a number of additional features besides moving 
		the camera, most of which are accessed using hotkeys. The following 
		table contains an overview of these additional features and their 
		hotkeys:</p>
	<table>
		<tr class="head">
			<td>Program Feature</td>

				Dialog</a></td>
			<td>H or F1</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<a name="hotkeys-infobox">
	<h2>Info Box</h2></a>
	<p>The Info Box contains various information about the selected galaxy:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Object ID</strong> is a number uniquely identifying each 
			galaxy and can be used in conjunction with the <a 
			href="#hotkeys-jumpdialog">Jump Dialog</a> to direct another user to 
			a specific galaxy.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Redshift</strong> represents the factor by which a 
			galaxy's observed spectrum is shifted from what we would observe if 
			it were nearby. It is this measurement that allows us to calculate 
			distances to galaxies.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Comoving Radial Distance</strong> represents the spatial 
			separation of the galaxy from the origin at the present epoch, 
			assuming zero peculiar velocity with respect to our own galaxy. It 
			is calculated using the currently active <a 
			href="#options-cosmology">cosmology constants</a>.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Stamp Size</strong> is the length of one side of the 
			black box surrounding the galaxy's picture. Thus if a galaxy takes 
			up roughly half the width of the box and has a stamp size of 30 kpc, 
			its proper transverse diameter should be about 15 kpc.</li>
		<li>The <strong>More Information Link</strong> links to a web page 
			containing additional data for the selected galaxy. This includes 
			its position (RA and Dec) and spectral fitting data. Note that not 
			all galaxies have this additional information available. 
			Specifically, it is available only for those galaxies that were 
			included in the <a href="http://wwwgrapes.dyndns.org/">GRAPES</a> 
			survey, which are most of the bright, large galaxies.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Jump Button</strong> moves the camera to a view centered 
			on the selected galaxy, exactly as if the galaxy's ID number had 
			been entered into the <a href="#hotkeys-jumpdialog">Jump 
			Dialog</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	</div>
	<a name="hotkeys-geometry">
	<h2>Spatial Geometry Mode</h2></a>
	<p>Toggling the spatial geometry mode changes between the Universe's actual 
		geometry and a geometry where angular sizes are unaffected by the 
		expansion of the Universe. This second geometry does not have a physical 
		analogue - it does <em>not</em> represent what the Universe would look 
		like if it were not expanding, or any other such set of circumstances. 
		Instead, it is provided simply to convey visually that observed angular 
		sizes have been affected by the scale factor.</p>
	<a name="hotkeys-jumpdialog">
	<h2>Jump Dialog</h2></a>
	<p>The Jump Dialog is a way to quickly move to a specific location. If you 
		enter an Object ID number then the simulation will move the camera to a 
		position centered on that object. This is useful for labs that require 
		students to examine a number of specific galaxies. If no Object ID is 
		entered then the simulation will move the camera to the specified 
		redshift, leaving the x and y coordinates fixed.</p>
	<a name="hotkeys-reset">
	<h2>Resetting</h2></a>
	<p>Using the reset function will reset the simulation, exactly as if the 
		application had been newly opened. This includes reloading all galaxies 
		- both images and position data - as well as recalculating all distances 
		and moving the camera to the origin. It also resets the graphics 
		rendering thread, so may be used in the event that images fail to 
		update.</p>
	<a name="hotkeys-helpdialog">
	<h2>Help and Options Dialog</h2></a>
	<p>The Help and Options Dialog gives you basic information about running the 
		application, such as movement controls, as well as allowing you to 
		modify some of the simulation's configuration parameters at runtime. It 
		is discussed in detail in the next section. Additionally, the license 
		for the software is also provided in this dialog.</p>

	<a name="options">
	<h1>Changing Options and Settings</h1></a>
	<p>There are two primary ways of changing options and settings for the 
		application. These are the <a href="#config">Configuration File</a>, 
		which will be covered in the next section, and the options pane of the 
		Help and Options Dialog. The options pane contains two primary sections, 
		<a href="#options-cosmology">Cosmology Parameters</a> and <a 
		href="#options-performance">Program Performance</a>.</p>
	<a name="options-cosmology">
	<h2>Cosmology Parameters</h2></a>
	<p>The Cosmology Parameters section allows you to modify certain constants 
		of the displayed cosmology. There are currently four parameters that may 
		be modified at runtime:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong> is the Hubble Constant, which goes 
			into Hubble's Law relating recessional velocity and distance. It is 
			also used when obtaining proper distances from coordinate distances 
			within the application. Its units are km/s/Mpc.</li>
		<li><strong>&Omega;<sub>M</sub></strong> is the matter density parameter 
			of the Universe. It represents what fraction of the total energy 
			density of the Universe is attributable to matter, both baryonic and 
			dark.</li>
		<li><strong>&Omega;<sub>&Lambda;</sub></strong> is the so-called vacuum 
			energy density parameter of the Universe. It represents what 
			fraction of the total energy density of the Universe is attributable 
			to dark energy, ie. expansion energy associated with the 
			Cosmological Constant, &Lambda;.</li>
		<li><strong>&Omega;<sub>R</sub></strong> is the radiation density 
			parameter of the Universe. It represents what fraction of the total 
			energy density of the Universe is attributable to radiation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The curvature parameter, &Omega;<sub>K</sub> is derived from these 
		supplied parameters internally as &Omega;<sub>K</sub> = 1 - 
		(&Omega;<sub>M</sub> + &Omega;<sub>&Lambda;</sub> + 
		&Omega;<sub>R</sub>). Most changes to these parameters will result in 
		rather subtle visual effects - they will manifest primarily as changes 
		to the comoving radial distance in a galaxy's Info Box. Curvatures that 
		are very large in magnitude (|&Omega;<sub>K</sub>|&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;1) 
		may result in more marked visual differences.</p>
	<a name="options-performance">
	<h2>Program Performance</h2></a>
	<p>The Program Performance section contains one value that may be changed at 
		runtime - the Cull Size. It sets the smallest size in pixels for which 
		a galaxy's image will be displayed - if a galaxy's size is smaller than 
		the Cull Size, the galaxy will be displayed as a single pixel of its 
		averaged color. Modification of this value is provided as a way to 
		adjust the speed at which the application runs. The most CPU-intensive 
		task is resizing and displaying images, so by increasing the Cull Size 
		you may decrease the number of displayed images and thus increase the 
		speed of the simulation. Note that <em>decreasing</em> the Cull Size 
		will provide better visuals but could potentially slow the application 
		down significantly.</p>

	<span class="jump"><a href="#index">Back to Index</a></span>
	
	<a name="config">
	<h1>Configuration File and Advanced Options</h1></a>
	<p>In addition to <a href="#options">runtime options</a> in the Help and 
		Options Dialog, you may create or download an optional configuration 
		file to modify the application's default behavior. This file is simply a 
		specially formatted text file called <code>ahah.conf</code> that must be 
		placed in the same directory as <code>ahah.jar</code>. The options are 
		placed in the file as Key&nbsp;:&nbsp;Value pairs separated by a colon. 
		For example the line <code>OmegaM&nbsp;:&nbsp;0.237</code> sets 
		&Omega;<sub>M</sub> to 0.237, the currently accepted COBE/WMAP value. 
		Comments within the file are preceded by <code>#</code> and section 
		headings (optional) are placed in brackets, such as <code>[Cosmology 
		Constants]</code>. Keys other than those below will simply be ignored, 
		and giving a key an improper value (such as a floating point number 
		where an integer is required) will cause the application to print an 
		error and then use the default value. The available options are as 
		follows:</p>
	<a name="config-appoptions">
	<h2>Application Operation Options</h2></a>
	<p>Options in this section change the default behaviors of how the 
		application runs, including performance tweaks.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>FrameSleepTime</strong> is an <code>integer</code> that 
			specifies the time in milliseconds to wait between redraws of the 
			main simulation window. A shorter time will update the viewport more 
			often, but be more taxing on the CPU. Modifying the default value 
			may affect performance drastically.</li>
		<li><strong>MacroStepDelay</strong> is an <code>integer</code> that 
			specifies the time in milliseconds to wait between steps of an 
			automatic move (when double-clicking on a galaxy). A shorter time 
			will result in smoother, faster movement</li>
		<li><strong>CullSize</strong> is an <code>integer</code> that specifies 
			the default Cull Size, as discussed in the <a 
			href="#options">Options and Settings</a> section above. This way if 
			you have a particularly fast computer, you can force the application 
			to use a smaller Cull Size every time you run it. Thus you would not 
			have to open the Help and Options Dialog to change it every time. 
			Note that modifying the value at runtime using the Help and Options 
			Dialog will always override any value in the configuration 
			file.</li>
		<li><strong>DefaultBrowser</strong> is a <code>string</code> 
			representing your preferred browser command on *nix systems. If you 
			do not change the setting yourself, the application will try, in 
			order: <code>firefox</code>, <code>mozilla</code>, 
			<code>opera</code>, <code>konqueror</code>, <code>epiphany</code>, 
			<code>netscape</code>. The value set in the configuration file is 
			simply any shell command, so may be something in <code>$PATH</code> 
			like <code>firefox</code>, or the full path such as 
			<code>/usr/local/share/firefox/firefox</code>. On Windows and Mac 
			OS, the operating system's default browser is always used, so 
			modifying this setting will have no effect.</li>
	</ul>
	<a name="config-cosmology">
	<h2>Cosmology Constants</h2></a>
	<p>Options in this section set the defaults for various cosmology constants. 
		For more detailed explanations, see the <a 
		href="#options-cosmology">descriptions</a> for the parameters in the 
		Options and Settings section above. Like the Cull Size, changing the 
		values at runtime using the Help and Options Dialog will override 
		settings in the configuration file.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HNought</strong> is a <code>floating point</code> number 
			that specifies the default value of the Hubble Constant, 
			H<sub>0</sub>.</li>
		<li><strong>OmegaM</strong> is a <code>floating point</code> number that 
			specifies the default value of the matter density parameter, 
			&Omega;<sub>M</sub>.</li>
		<li><strong>OmegaV</strong> is a <code>floating point</code> number that 
			specifies the default value of the vacuum energy density parameter, 
			&Omega;<sub>&Lambda;</sub>.</li>
		<li><strong>OmegaR</strong> is a <code>floating point</code> number that 
			specifies the default value of the radiation density parameter, 
			&Omega;<sub>R</sub>.</li>
	</ul>
	<a name="config-dataset">
	<h2>Dataset Information</h2></a>
	<p>Options in this section give the application information about the 
		original image that the individual stamps come from, as well as 
		specifying where to find the object database. Options from this section
		should generally not be changed by users - they are provided for future 
		use of the application with different data.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>DBFile</strong> is a <code>string</code> representing the 
			path of the database file <em>within the jar file</em>. This should 
			only be modified if the application is repackaged with different 
			data. The file should be specified with the root of the path being 
			the root of the jar file, not of the computer's filesystem.</li>
		<li><strong>ImageSizePx</strong> is an <code>integer</code> specifying 
			the height and width of the original image in pixels. If for some 
			reason the image is not square, use whichever dimension is 
			larger.</li>
		<li><strong>ImageArcsecPerPx</strong> is a <code>floating point</code> 
			number that specifies the arcsec/px scale of the original image. 
			This is used internally for changing pixel sizes to angular sizes 
			and vice versa.</li>
		<li><strong>MaxRedshift</strong> in an <code>integer</code> that 
			specifies the maximum redshift for the distance tables. This need 
			only be sufficiently large such that no object in the database has a 
			higher redshift (as the program may then crash since it would not be 
			able to correctly interpolate the object's distance).</li>
	</ul>
	<a name="config-config">
	<h2>Application Configuration Constants</h2></a>
	<p>Options in this section change aspects of the application that users 
		generally do not need to modify, such as the locations of external 
		resources like this documentation. These options are provided primarily 
		as a convenience to website administrators in the event that urls 
		change, etc.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>StampURLBase</strong> is a <code>string</code> that 
			specifies the directory containing the <a 
			href="#hotkeys-infobox">More Information</a> html files for 
			galaxies. The provided string must contain the trailing 
			<code>/</code>. The application expects the html files within this 
			directory to be named <code>n.html</code>, where <code>n</code> is 
			the HUDF ID number of the object.</li>
		<li><strong>HelpURL</strong> is a <code>string</code> that indicates the 
			url of the application's online documentation, i.e. this page.</li>
		<li><strong>TextColor</strong> is a <code>hex code</code> that defines 
			the color of the text on the <a href="#mainscreen">Main Screen</a>. 
			The value is standard RGB hex encoding (like in HTML and CSS), i.e. 
			RRGGBB. For instance a deep purple would be encoded as 
			<code>TextColor&nbsp;:&nbsp;6633aa</code>.</li>
	</ul>

	<a name="license">
	<h1>License, Source Code, and Modifications</h1></a>
	<p>The Appreciating Hubble at Hyper-speed application is provided under a 
		<a href="./license.txt">BSD-like license</a>. In simple terms, this 
		means that virtually any modification or redistribution of the 
		application is permitted, with the following caveats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Any redistribution must retain the original copyright notice and 
			license file, either with the source code or with the documentation
			in the case of binary distributions.</li>
		<li>The names of the copyright holders, contributors, and associated 
			institutions may not be used to endorse or promote any derivative 
			works without prior permission.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that there is no requirement that source code be provided with any 
		derivative work or redistribution. We encourage any derivative works to 
		provide source code as well so that others may learn from your 
		modifications, but we leave such decisions to your discretion.</p>
	<h2>Application Source Code</h2>
	<p>The application's source code is provided with the standard distribution. 
		Java archives are simply standard ZIP (DEFLATE) archives with a special 
		internal directory structure. Thus, you need only extract the contents 
		of the archive using your favorite ZIP extractor (Using <code>jar</code> 
		you would run <code>jar&nbsp;-xf&nbsp;ahah.jar</code>). The application 
		source code is contained in the <code>src/</code> directory.</p>
	<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The <code>ahah.jar</code> file exhibits 
		"tarbomb" behavior, extracting to the current directory instead of its 
		own subdirectory. This is mostly a limitation of the jar format, since 
		the <code>META-INF/</code> directory must always be in the archive 
		root. We strongly suggest you <strong>move the archive to its own 
		directory before extracting it</strong>.</p>
	<p>To compile the source you simply need to run 
		<code>javac&nbsp;*.java</code>. The compiled binaries will automatically 
		be placed within the directory <code>edu/asu/Ahah/</code>. To run the 
		modified application you then need to create a new jar including the 
		directories <code>edu/</code>, <code>images/</code>, and 
		<code>data/</code>, as well as the files <code>defaults.conf</code> and 
		<code>license.txt</code>, and any source code if you desire. You also 
		need to specify a Manifest file, which must contain at least the line 
		<code>Main-Class: edu.asu.Ahah.Ahah</code> - this tells the Java 
		interpreter where to find the main class when a user runs the jar. An 
		example jar creation command is:</p>
	<p><code>jar -cvfm ahah.jar MANIFEST.MF edu images data src defaults.conf 
		license.txt</code></p>
