# Matt Mechtley, Ph.D., K.S.C.

I currently work as a client engineer for [Dire Wolf Digital](http://www.direwolfdigital.com/) in Denver, working on multiplayer card and strategy games. I do almost all of my gamedev work in [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com). I previously worked as the iPhone specialist and resident science pedant at indie video game developer [Flashbang Studios](http://blurst.com/). I contributed significantly to our games Splume, Off-Road Velociraptor Safari, Jetpack Brontosaurus, Minotaur in a China Shop, Rebolt, Blush, Crane Wars, and Time Donkey. I also developed the iPhone boxing game Touch KO with my brother Adam Mechtley.

## [Portfolio ‣]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio)

I have a Ph.D. in astrophysics and previously worked as an active researcher at Arizona State University and the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie in Heidelberg, Germany. My research expertise is on the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. I worked primarily with the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes, including the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, the European Very Large Telescope in Chile, and the Gemini telescopes in Hawaii and Chile. My dissertation, _Markov Chain Monte Carlo Modeling of High-Redshift Quasar Host Galaxies in Hubble Space Telescope Imaging_, is freely available via the link below. As an undergrad, I developed [Appreciating Hubble at Hyper-speed]({{site.baseurl}}/ahah/), an interactive simulation used as a teaching tool for introductory astronomy labs.

## [Research ‣]({{site.baseurl}}/research)

Outside of work I enjoy travel, hiking, cycling, citrus, and [making](http://makezine.com/) things, especially [custom electronics for video games]({% post_url 2009-04-03-the-power-glove-20th-anniversary-edition %}).
