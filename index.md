# Mira Mechtley, Ph.D., K.S.C.

I currently work as a lead engineer at [Dinogod](http://www.dinogod.com), working on [Bounty Star](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497430/Bounty_Star/). I do almost all of my gamedev work in [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com). I previously worked as a client/full-stack engineer at [Dire Wolf Digital](https://direwolfdigital.com), and as the iPhone specialist and resident science pedant at indie video game developer [Flashbang Studios](http://blurst.com/). I contributed significantly to Root and Eternal at Dire Wolf, and to Splume, Off-Road Velociraptor Safari, Jetpack Brontosaurus, Minotaur in a China Shop, Rebolt, Blush, Crane Wars, and Time Donkey at Flashbang. I also developed the iPhone boxing game Touch KO with my brother Adam Mechtley.

## [Portfolio ‣]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio)

I have a Ph.D. in astrophysics and previously worked as an active researcher at Arizona State University and the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie in Heidelberg, Germany. My research expertise is on the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. I worked primarily with the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes, including the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, the European Very Large Telescope in Chile, and the Gemini telescopes in Hawaii and Chile. My dissertation, _Markov Chain Monte Carlo Modeling of High-Redshift Quasar Host Galaxies in Hubble Space Telescope Imaging_, is freely available via the link below. As an undergrad, I developed [Appreciating Hubble at Hyper-speed]({{site.baseurl}}/ahah/), an interactive simulation used as a teaching tool for introductory astronomy labs.

## [Research ‣]({{site.baseurl}}/research)

Outside of work I enjoy travel, hiking, cycling, citrus, and [making](http://makezine.com/) things, especially [custom electronics for video games]({% post_url 2009-04-03-the-power-glove-20th-anniversary-edition %}).
