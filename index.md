# Matt Mechtley, Ph.D., K.S.C. #

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher living in Tallahassee, Florida and collaborating mainly with researchers from Arizona State University and the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Astronomie in Heidelberg, Germany. [My research]({{site.baseurl}}/research) focuses on the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. I work primarily with the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes, including the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, the European Very Large Telescope in Chile, and the Gemini telescopes in Hawaii and Chile.

I completed my Ph.D. in Astrophysics in December 2013 at Arizona State University, where I was advised by Prof. Rogier Windhorst. My dissertation, _Markov Chain Monte Carlo Modeling of High-Redshift Quasar Host Galaxies in Hubble Space Telescope Imaging_, is freely available via the link below.

I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from Arizona State University in 2007. As an undergrad, I developed [Appreciating Hubble at Hyper-speed]({{site.baseurl}}/ahah/), an interactive simulation used as a teaching tool for introductory astronomy labs.


Outside of work I enjoy travel, hiking, cycling, citrus, and [making](http://makezine.com/) things, especially custom electronics for video games. I previously worked as the iPhone specialist and resident science pedant at indie video game developer [Flashbang Studios](http://blurst.com/). I worked primarily with [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/), though I also did nearly all of the Cocoa/Objective-C programming on our iPhone games. I contributed significantly to our games Splume, Off-Road Velociraptor Safari, Jetpack Brontosaurus, Minotaur in a China Shop, Rebolt, Blush, Crane Wars, and Time Donkey. I also developed the iPhone boxing game Touch KO with my brother Adam Mechtley.
