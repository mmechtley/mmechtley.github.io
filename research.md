I deal mainly in **quasars** and **high-redshift galaxies**. My research for the past several years has dealt with studying the host galaxies of high-redshift quasars, especially to better understand quasar triggering or feeding mechanisms. I leverage my strong background in **programming** and **math** to analyze data using modern computational and statistical methods.

My dissertation work revolved around improved methods for modeling and subtracting quasar point sources from imaging data, especially Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 images. I developed [psfMC](https://github.com/mmechtley/psfMC), a software tool for Bayesian 2D surface brightness modeling -- think of it as MCMC [galfit](https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html). Users supply a [model file](https://github.com/mmechtley/psfMC/blob/master/examples/model_J0005-0006.py) defining a parameterized model (Any number of point sources, SÃ©rsic profiles, etc.) and prior distributions for each parameter, and the software then handles drawing MCMC samples from the posterior distribution. It propagates per-pixel statistical uncertainties and produces a series of images as well as a trace database of the posterior samples. You can then learn about parameter covariances that the simpler gradient descent methods don't provide.
